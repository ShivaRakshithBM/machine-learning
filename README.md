# machine-learning

This is a repository that has the codes developed for different machine learning algorithms. Look for updates here.... Currently in the process of creating the codes for neural networks.

12/21 - Created a simple perceptron that can imitate AND and OR functions

12/25 - Created a linear perceptron to learn weights using the batch gradient descent algorithm

12/25 - Added Stochistic/incremental Gradient Descent as well
