# machine-learning

This is a repository that has the codes developed for different machine learning algorithms. Look for updates here.... Currently in the process of creating the codes for neural networks.

12/21 - Created a simple perceptron that can imitate AND and OR functions

12/25 - Created a linear perceptron to learn weights using the batch gradient descent algorithm

12/25 - Added Stochistic/incremental Gradient Descent as well

12/26 - Link to Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop

12/27 - Added Stochasticity to selection of samples for training in incremental gradient descent.
To Do:
linearPerceptron - v2.py
  1. Error plots
  2. Iteration errors on training and test sets

12/27 - Added R script for Random Forests based prediction of sales (Analytics Vidhya)

12/28 - Script moved to Analytics Vidhya Repository

12/30 - Linear Perceptron script includes plotting of error surfaces
Next steps - Add iteration error plots for train and validation tests

01/01 - Added code for neural nets. Need to complete derivartions for batch and stochastic backprop algorithms

01/02 - Added new notebook with neural nets newer implementation. Layers are now built as objects and have forward and backward processes of their own
