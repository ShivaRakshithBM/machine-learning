All codes related to linear perceptrons are placed here

12/21 - Created a simple perceptron that can imitate AND and OR functions

12/25 - Created a linear perceptron to learn weights using the batch gradient descent algorithm

12/25 - Added Stochistic/incremental Gradient Descent as well

12/27 - Added Stochasticity to selection of samples for training in incremental gradient descent.
To Do:
linearPerceptron - v2.py
  1. Error plots
  2. Iteration errors on training and test sets

12/27 - Added R script for Random Forests based prediction of sales (Analytics Vidhya)

12/28 - Script moved to Analytics Vidhya Repository

12/30 - Linear Perceptron script includes plotting of error surfaces
